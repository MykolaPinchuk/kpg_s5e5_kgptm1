The objective of this project is to create a simple POC ML model. It is for Kaggle playground Season5 Episode5 dataset. 

You can use kaggle api to pull data for this competition (competition_name = 'playground-series-s5e5'). kaggle.json file is available in current dir.

The main objective of this project is to create POC fast. Do not worry about getting model with very high performance. I suggest using a small subsample to speed up model training. 

You are not allowed to access Kaggle website.

After getting human approval on implementing high-level plan, go ahead and do it. Do not ask human any questions. The final output of this project are predictions on a test set which human will submit for evaluation to Kaggle.
